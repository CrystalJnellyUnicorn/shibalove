<h1>SHIBA INUS ROCK!!!</h1>

   Shiba Inus are from Japan. They have curled tails and I think they are super cute.<br>
Most Shiba Inus live 12-15 years.<br>
Did you know Shiba Inus are on the Japanese dollar bill? Shiba Inus are a legacy in Japan, and they are important. It isn't a suprise that Shiba Inus are on the dollar bill.<br>
<h2>
Shiba Inu Orgin
</h2>
If you look at Shiba Inus now, you fluffy, cute, and playful puppies. But if you look into their orgin, you can see how feirce they are. Let's take a look.<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Shiba Inus used to be hunting dogs in Japan back in the day until World War 2. They almost went extinct! Because of that, we have the playful fluffballs which are becoming more popular in the U.S by the day!</li><br>
<li>Did you know a Shiba Inu has once saved her owners from an earthquake? That's one brave dog.</li>
</ol>
